Topic:  Visualization of Inter & Intra-Continental Human Trafficking (HT)

Source Data:  GLOBAL DATA HUB ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING which currently has 91,000 reports from 179 countries from 2002 to 2017, https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/

1. Used Excel to summarize 92,000 reported HT cases, from 2002 to 2018, by 172 participating countries by continent:  their citizenship (if known), their alleged exploitation, their gender, and whether it was a Sex crime.
2. Summary statistics are translated to JSON and embedded into js code (because I couldn’t get d3.csv to work).
3. Results are rendered, using D3, as a Sankey Diagram to show the relative frequency of citizens from one continent being exploited in the same continent or another, broken down by gender and whether the reported trafficking was a sex crime.  
4. Additional analysis by country (within the continents) is provided by interactive Tableau dashboards.
